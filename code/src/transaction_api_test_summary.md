# Transaction API Test Summary

## Overview
We conducted extensive testing of the Banking API, with a focus on the transaction functionality. This document summarizes our findings.

## Test Approach
1. Created BDD test scenarios for the transaction API
2. Implemented step definitions for making transactions
3. Created direct test scripts to test the transaction functionality
4. Ran multiple tests with different payload formats

## Successful API Endpoints
The following API endpoints were tested and found to be working correctly:
- `PUT /api/v1/accounts` - Successfully creates accounts
- `POST /api/v1/deposit` - Successfully deposits funds into accounts
- `POST /api/v1/accounts` (balance check) - Successfully retrieves account balances
- `POST /api/v1/withdraw` - Successfully withdraws funds from accounts

## Transaction API Issue
We identified a critical issue with the transaction API endpoint:

- **Issue**: When a transaction is made from one account to another, the source account is debited correctly, but the target account is not credited.
- **Expected behavior**: Money should be transferred from source account to target account, with both balances updating correctly.
- **Actual behavior**: Money is deducted from source account but not added to target account.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create two accounts (source and target)
2. Deposit funds into source account
3. Make a transaction from source to target
4. Check balances of both accounts

### Payload Format
The transaction API expects the following payload format:
```json
{
  "amount": 500.0,
  "sourceAccount": {
    "sortCode": "15-83-54",
    "accountNumber": "85442271"
  },
  "targetAccount": {
    "sortCode": "16-99-79",
    "accountNumber": "33468318"
  },
  "reference": "Test transaction",
  "latitude": 51.5074,
  "longitude": 0.1278
}
```

### Response
The API returns status code 200 with a response body of `true` for successful transactions, but the target account balance is not updated.

## Conclusion
The transaction functionality is partially implemented. While it successfully deducts money from the source account, it fails to credit the target account with the transaction amount. This is a critical issue that needs to be fixed for the transaction feature to be fully functional.

## Recommendations
1. Investigate the transaction service implementation to identify why the target account is not being credited
2. Fix the issue to ensure both accounts are properly updated during a transaction
3. Add validation to ensure transactions are only completed if both the debit and credit operations succeed
4. Implement proper error handling for the transaction API to provide meaningful error messages
