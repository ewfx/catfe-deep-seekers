# BDD Test Case Generation for API Endpoints

You are an expert in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing. Given the API endpoint information below, generate Gherkin-format BDD test scenarios for the endpoint. Include both happy path and negative test cases where appropriate.

For each endpoint, generate:
1. Feature description and business value
2. At least 3 scenarios (including positive and negative flows)
3. Given-When-Then steps that are specific to the endpoint functionality
4. Include parameter validation tests where applicable
5. Include authentication/authorization test cases where appropriate

Focus on business value and user-centered scenarios rather than technical implementation details.
